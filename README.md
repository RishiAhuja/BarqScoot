## Overview

BarqScoot is a modern e-scooter rental application designed to provide a seamless user experience for locating, reserving, and riding electric scooters. This mobile application is built using Flutter and follows clean architecture principles for maintainability and scalability.

The app allows users to register and login using their phone number via OTP verification, locate nearby scooters, scan QR codes to unlock vehicles, and manage their trips with real-time tracking and payment processing.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture

BarqScoot implements Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Presentation Layer] --> B[Domain Layer]
    B --> C[Data Layer]
    C --> D[External Services/APIs]
    
    subgraph "Presentation Layer"
      A1[Screens/UI] --> A2[Providers/Controllers]
    end
    
    subgraph "Domain Layer"
      B1[Use Cases] --> B2[Entities]
      B3[Repository Interfaces] --> B2
      B1 --> B3
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
      C1[Repository Implementations] --> C2[Data Sources]
      C2 --> C3[API Services]
      C2 --> C4[Local Storage]
    end
```

### Project Structure

The project follows a feature-first organization approach, where each feature is a complete vertical slice:

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── configs/
│   │   ├── constants/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   ├── storage/
│   │   ├── theme/
│   ├── di/
│   │   ├── service_locator/
│   ├── error/
│   ├── usecases/

│   ├── scanner/
│   ├── etc.
├── common/
│   ├── router/
│   ├── widgets/
├── l10n/
├── utils/
```

### Dependency Flow

The app follows a strict dependency rule where inner layers don't know about outer layers:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[UI] --> B[Providers/Controllers]
    B --> C[Use Cases]
    C --> D[Repository Interfaces]
    E[Repository Implementations] --> D
    E --> F[Remote Data Sources]
    E --> G[Local Data Sources]
    F --> H[API Services]
    G --> I[Local Storage]
```

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Phone number based OTP authentication
- **Scooter Locator**: Map integration to find nearby scooters
- **QR Code Scanning**: Scan to unlock scooters
- **Trip Management**: Start, monitor and end rides
- **User Profile**: Management of user data and preferences
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing

## Authentication Flow

BarqScoot uses phone number + OTP verification for secure authentication:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant App
    participant AuthService
    participant Backend
    
    User->>App: Enter phone number
    App->>AuthService: loginWithPhone(phoneNumber)
    AuthService->>Backend: /auth/login
    Backend->>Backend: Generate OTP
    Backend->>User: SMS with OTP code
    Backend-->>AuthService: Return verificationId
    AuthService-->>App: Return verificationId
    
    User->>App: Enter OTP code
    App->>AuthService: verifyOtp(phoneNumber, verificationId, otp)
    AuthService->>Backend: /auth/verify-otp
    Backend->>Backend: Verify OTP
    Backend-->>AuthService: Return token and user data
    AuthService->>AuthService: Store token and user data
    AuthService-->>App: Authentication complete
    App->>User: Navigate to Home
```

## State Management

BarqScoot uses **Riverpod** for state management:

- **StateNotifier** for complex state management
- **AsyncValue** for handling loading, error, and success states
- **Providers** for dependency injection and scoping

Example of state management pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[UI] --> B[Provider]
    B --> C[State Notifier]
    C --> D[Use Case]
    D --> E[Repository]
    E --> F[API Service]
    
    B --> G[State: AsyncValue]
    G -- Loading --> A
    G -- Data --> A
    G -- Error --> A
```

## Dependency Injection

The app uses **GetIt** and **injectable** for dependency injection:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Service Locator] --> B[API Services]
    A --> C[Repositories]
    A --> D[Use Cases]
    A --> E[Controllers]
    A --> F[Local Storage]
```

This allows for:
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy mocking for testing
- Runtime resolution of dependencies
- Singleton and factory patterns as needed

## Navigation

BarqScoot implements **go_router** for declarative routing:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GoRouter] --> B[Auth Routes]
    A --> C[Home Routes]
    A --> D[Scanner Routes]
    A --> E[Profile Routes]
    
    B --> B1[Login Screen]
    B --> B2[Register Screen]
    B --> B3[OTP Verification Screen]
    
    C --> C1[Map Screen]
    C --> C2[Scooter Details Screen]
    
    D --> D1[QR Scanner Screen]
    
    E --> E1[Profile Screen]
    E --> E2[Payment Methods Screen]
```

Navigation is handled through:
- Path-based navigation
- Screen transitions with animations
- Deep linking support
- Parameter passing between routes

## Local Storage

BarqScoot uses **Hive** for efficient local storage:

- User authentication tokens
- User profile data
- Application preferences
- Recent ride history

## API Integration

The app communicates with RESTful backend services:

- Authentication endpoints
- Scooter location and availability
- Trip management
- Payment processing

Error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented for robust API communication.

## Error Handling

BarqScoot implements comprehensive error handling:

- API errors with proper user feedback
- Network connectivity issues
- Form validation with helpful messages
- Graceful degradation for offline usage
- Structured error logging for debugging
